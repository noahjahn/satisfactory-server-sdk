# Introduction

Dedicated Server API consists of two separate endpoints, both operating on the same port as the game server, which is normally 7777.
If the server port is changed (through Engine.ini configuration file, or through -Port= command line argument), the API will listen on the
specified port instead.

Dedicated Server API endpoints:

- Dedicated Server Lightweight Query API is a simple UDP protocol designed for polling the server state through UDP continuously
  with minimal overhead.
- Dedicated Server HTTPS API is a HTTPS server serving the requests to retrieve the more detailed state of the server, and control it's behavior.

# Lightweight Query API

Lightweight Query API is a lightweight API designed to allow continuously pulling data from the server and track server state changes.

## Protocol

Lightweight Query is a simple request-response UDP protocol with a message-based approach.
Note that all data used in the Lightweight Query API is always _Little Endian_, and not of network byte order.
Since the protocol is UDP, it is unreliable, which means some of the requests might be dropped or not receive responses, so instead
of waiting for the responses you should attempt to ping the server with a specific time interval.
Be wary of not trying to ping a dead Lightweight Query API for too long though, since you might end up triggering anti-DDoS measures on the host network.

The protocol consists of a simple message envelope format used for all messages:

| Offset (bytes)    | Data Type   | Name            | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0                 | uint16 (LE) | ProtocolMagic   | Always set to 0xF6D5                                                           |
| 2                 | uint8       | MessageType     | Type ID of the payload in this envelope. See table down for details            |
| 3                 | uint8       | ProtocolVersion | Version of the protocol desired by the client. Current protocol version is _1_ |
| ...               | Variant     | Payload         | Payload of the message. Specific to the message type.                          |
| 3+sizeof(Payload) | uint8       | Terminator Byte | Always 0x1. Messages not ending with the terminator byte will be discarded.    |

The following message types are currently supported.

| Message Type | Name                  | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | Poll Server State     | A request sent to the API to retrieve the information about the current server state            |
| 1            | Server State Response | A response sent by the server API back to the client containing the current state of the server |

Server Sub State is a sequential counter that is incremented by the server each time a state of the relevant system changes.
This allows determining a set of data that the API client needs to refresh when the server changes it, without having to continuously poll the HTTPS API.

ServerSubState structure is defined as following:

| Offset (bytes) | Data Type   | Name            | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0              | uint8       | SubStateId      | ID of the sub state being changed. See Server Sub States for list of values |
| 8              | uint16 (LE) | SubStateVersion | Current changelist of the sub state                                         |

### Server State Enum

| Enum Value | Enum Name | Description                                                                    |

### Server Sub States

The following sub states are currently defined by the vanilla dedicated server.
Sub states that are not known are not invalid, and should instead be silently discarded.

| Sub State ID | Sub State Name       | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | ServerGameState      | Game state of the server. Maps to QueryServerState HTTPS API function                                                   |
| 1            | ServerOptions        | Global options set on the server. Maps to GetServerOptions HTTPS API function                                           |
| 2            | AdvancedGameSettings | Advanced Game Settings in the currently loaded session. Maps to GetAdvancedGameSettings HTTPS API function              |
| 3            | SaveCollection       | List of saves available on the server for loading/downloading has changed. Maps to EnumerateSessions HTTPS API function |
| 4            | Custom1              | A value that can be used by the mods or custom servers. Not used by the vanilla clients or servers                      |
| 5            | Custom2              | A value that can be used by the mods or custom servers. Not used by the vanilla clients or servers                      |
| 6            | Custom3              | A value that can be used by the mods or custom servers. Not used by the vanilla clients or servers                      |
| 7            | Custom4              | A value that can be used by the mods or custom servers. Not used by the vanilla clients or servers                      |

## Flow

A client sends a message of type Poll Server State to the Server API with it's Cookie. When the server receives the message, it will send the
Server State Response message to the relevant client, with the Cookie value on the response copied from the received request.

A client can continuously poll the server for the updates using that API without using much of server CPU, and investigate the changes
in the Server Sub States changelists to determine which subset of information it has cached locally from the HTTPS API could need to be re-fetched from the server.

## API Availability

Lightweight Server Query API is available at all times when the server is running, except for when it is starting up. When the server is performing
a save game load or a map change, the lightweight query API will retain it's availability, but will report Loading as the server status.
In that state, HTTPS API becomes temporarily unavailable until the blocking work on the server is finished.

# HTTPS API

Dedicated Server HTTPS API is designed for reliably retrieving data from the running dedicated server instance, and performing the server management.
It is available when the server has started up and not actively loading a save game or performing a map change. To check for the HTTPS API availability,
Lightweight Query API can be used.

## Certificate Validation and Encryption

HTTPS API is always wrapped into the TLS tunnel, even if the user did not provide the certificate for the Dedicated Server.

User Certificate will be looked up at the following path (where `$InstallRoot$` is the path where the Dedicated Server is installed):

| File Path                                                | File type               | Description                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `$InstallRoot$/FactoryGame/Certificates/cert_chain.pem`  | Certificate Chain (PEM) | Certificate chain in PEM format         |
| `$InstallRoot$/FactoryGame/Certificates/private_key.pem` | Private Key (PEM)       | Certificate's private key in PEM format |

If no Certificate is provided by the user, Dedicated Server will generate it's own self-signed certificate and use it to encrypt
all traffic flowing through the HTTPS API. As such, the clients should be able to handle the HTTPS certificate being self-signed, recognize
that case, and handle it appropriately.

The game client, when presented with a self signed certificate from the Dedicated Server, will present it to the user and ask them to
manually confirm that the certificate in question is from a trusted authority. Once the user confirms it, the certificate is cached locally,
and is trusted for that specific server until the user revokes it or the server changes the certificate.

## Schema

HTTPS API is based on a simple JSON schema used to pass data to the functions executing on the server, and pass the responses back to the caller.
All Server API functions are always executed as POST requests, although certain query requests support being executed through the GET
requests, provided that they do not require any data to be provided to them.

### Request Schema

Content Type for requests should be set to application/json. Encoding should preferably be set to utf-8, but Dedicated Servers
support all encoding supported by the ICU localization library.

Request Object has the following properties:

| Property Name | Property Type | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| function      | string        | Name of the API function to execute. Names of the API functions and their behavior is described below |
| data          | object        | Data to pass to the function to execute. Format of the object depends on the function being executed  |

Dedicated Server HTTPS API supports the following standard headers:

| Header Name      | Notes                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Encoding | Optional. Only gzip and deflate are supported                                                                        |
| Authorization    | Required for most non-Authorization API functions. Only Bearer tokens are supported. See Authorization for more info |

The following Satisfactory-specific headers can be also be used in the request:

| Header Name | Data Type | Description |
| X-FactoryGame-PlayerId | Hex String | Hex-encoded byte array encoding the ID of the player on behalf of which the request is made |

X-FactoryGame-PlayerId header is only needed to obtain the server join/encryption tickets used for joining the server,
and it's format is highly specific to the Satisfactory version running, Unreal Engine version, and the Online Backend used by the player.

Generally, first byte of the ID will be type of the Online Backend used (1 for Epic Games Store, 6 for Steam, see values in UE's EOnlineServices type),
and the following bytes are specific to the Online Backend, but will generally represent the player account ID.
For Steam for example, it would be a big-endian uint64 representing the player's SteamID64, and for Epic, it would be HEX-encoded EOS ProductUserId string.

### Response Schema

Dedicated Server can return a variety of different HTTP status codes, most prominent ones are described here:

| Status Code | Status Code Name  | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200         | Ok                | The function has been executed successfully. The response body will either be a Error Response or a Success Response                                  |
| 201         | Created           | The function has been executed and returned no error. Returned by some functions to indicate that a new file has been created, such as UploadSaveGame |
| 202         | Accepted          | The function has been executed, but is still being processed. This is returned by some functions with side deffects, such as LoadGame                 |
| 204         | No Content        | The function has been executed successfully, but returned no data (and no error)                                                                      |
| 400         | Bad Request       | Only returned when the request body was failed to be parsed as valid JSON or multipart request. In other cases, error response bad_request is used    |
| 401         | Denied            | Authentication token is missing, cannot be parsed, or has expired                                                                                     |
| 403         | Forbidden         | Provided authentication does not allow executing the provided function, or when function requiring authentication is called without one               |
| 404         | Not Found         | The specified function cannot be found, or when the function cannot find the specified resource in some cases (for example, for DownloadSaveGame)     |
| 415         | Unsupported Media | Specified charset or content encoding is not supported, or multipart data is malformed                                                                |
| 500         | Server Error      | An internal server error has occurred when executing the function                                                                                     |

Content Type of the server response will be set to application/json and utf-8 encoding.
Depending on the outcome of the operation, it might return either an error response or a data response.

Error Response has the following structure:

| Property Name | Property Type | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| errorCode     | string        | Machine-friendly code indicating the type of the error that the executed function returned         |
| errorMessage  | string?       | Optional. Human-friendly error message explaining the error                                        |
| errorData     | object?       | Optional. Additional information about the error, for example, list of parameters that are missing |

Success Response has the following structure:

| Property Name | Property Type | Description                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| data          | object?       | Data returned by the function executed. Type depends on the function the request performed |

### File Responses

Certain Dedicated Server API functions can respond with a file attachment instead of using the standard Server Response JSON schema.
Such responses can be distinguished by the presence of the Content-Disposition header, indicating that the Content-Type and body represent
a file attachment and not a standard Server API response body.

Such functions can still return normal server response in case of Error Response.
Currently the only function that utilizies the File Response functionality is DownloadSaveGame, which returns the save game file as a response
without any additional Server API metadata attachments.

### Multipart Requests

Certain Server API functions can take both Server API request payload and a file attachment. Such functions should use multipart/form-data
Content-Type, and encode both the payload and the Server API request body as separate multipart parts.

Multipart Part named "data" should be present in all multipart requests, and encode the request object JSON with the same schema and
restrictions as the normal non-multipart requests. The charset should be provided as a separate multipart part with a special name "_charset_",
and contain the name of the charset used for encoding the Server API request as a plain text.

Names of other multipart attachments are specific to the functions using multipart requests.
Currently multipart requests are only used by UploadSaveGame function for uploading save game files.

## Authentication

Dedicated Server API requires authentication for most of it's functions. Authentication format used are Bearer tokens, which are issued
by the Dedicated Server when using certain API functions that require no Authentication (such as PasswordlessLogin), or functions that require
additional security verification (such as PasswordLogin). Tokens generated by these functions are short-lived and are bound to the specific player account.

Authentication Tokens internally consist of two parts separated by the dot character ('.'):

- Base64-encoded JSON token payload
- HEX-encoded Fingerprint

JSON token payload can be retrieved to determine the privilege level granted by the token, while fingerprint part is used by the server
to check the validity of the token and whenever it can be used currently.

Internal Authentication Token Payload:
| Property Name | Property Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pl | string | Privilege Level granted by this token. See possible values below |

Possible Privilege Level values:

| Privilege Level  | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NotAuthenticated | The client is not Authenticated                                              |
| Client           | Client is Authenticated with Client privileges                               |
| Administrator    | Client is Authenticated with Admin privileges                                |
| InitialAdmin     | Client is Authenticated as Initial Admin with privileges to Claim the server |
| APIToken         | Client is Authenticated as Third Party Application                           |

The following functions are used by the game client to perform player authentication:

| Function Name             | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PasswordlessLogin         | Attempts logging in as a player without a password.                       |
| PasswordLogin             | Attempts logging in as a player with a password.                          |
| VerifyAuthenticationToken | Checks if the provided Authentication token is valid. Returns Ok if valid |

Third Party Applications should NOT use PasswordLogin or PasswordlessLogin, and should instead rely on the Application Tokens.

Application tokens do not expire, and are granted by issuing the command `server.GenerateAPIToken` in the Dedicated Server console.
The generated token can then be passed to the Authentication header with Bearer type to perform any Server API requests on the behalf of the server.

Application tokens generated previously can still be pruned using `server.InvalidateAPITokens` console command.

Authentication requirement can be lifted for locally running Dedicated Server instances serving on the loopback network adapter.
To allow unrestricted Dedicated Server API access on the localhost, set `FG.DedicatedServer.AllowInsecureLocalAccess` console variable to `1`.
It can be performed automatically using the following command line argument:
`-ini:Engine:[SystemSettings]:FG.DedicatedServer.AllowInsecureLocalAccess=1`
