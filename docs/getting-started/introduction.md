# Introduction

> The documentation here is meant to get you up and running and making requests with your existing dedicated Satisfactory Server.

::: tip Looking to set up a dedicated Satisfactory Server?

We recommend running with Docker. We use the [satisfactory-server](https://github.com/wolveix/satisfactory-server) Docker image by [@wolveix](https://github.com/wolveix)

## What is this and why was it made?

Satisfactory 1.0 released September 10th and with it came many [updates and improvements](https://youtu.be/v8piXNQwcUw%C2%A0) to their dedicated server, including an HTTP API. To make it easier for devs to use and consume those APIs [@lundjrl](https://github.com/lundjrl) and [@noahjahn](https://github.com/noahjahn) thought it'd be fun to write an SDK for said API. We're planning to build some other tools using this SDK, but want to let others use it as well.

Our goal with the SDK is to focus on Developer Experience (DX) and make sure the tool is as intuitive as possible.

### Yeah, but why TS/JS??

## How do I get started?

Take a look at the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start), it will walk you through installation and using the SDK.
